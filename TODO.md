# HalalChain Frontend Implementation TODO

## Current Work
Implementing the frontend for the HalalChain e-commerce marketplace using Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS v4, TypeScript. The project is being initialized in `apps/frontend/`. Once setup is complete, we'll build core features based on the approved plan.

## Key Technical Concepts
- Next.js 15 with App Router for server-side rendering and routing.
- Tailwind CSS v4 for utility-first styling, responsive design.
- TypeScript for type safety.
- ESLint for code quality.
- API integration with NestJS backend (using fetch or axios for endpoints like /products, /auth/login).
- Reusable components with React patterns.
- State management: Basic useState/useEffect; consider Zustand for global state if needed.
- Authentication: JWT tokens stored in cookies/localStorage, protected routes.

## Relevant Files and Code
- Initial setup via `create-next-app` (in progress): Generates `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.js`, `next.config.js`, basic pages in `src/app/`.
- No custom code yet; will create:
  - `src/components/` for UI components.
  - `src/app/` for pages (home, products, etc.).
  - `src/lib/api.ts` for API client.
  - `src/types/` for TypeScript interfaces (e.g., Product, User).

## Problem Solving
- Backend integration: Ensure CORS enabled on backend for frontend origin (localhost:3000).
- Halal compliance: UI elements for certification badges, vendor verification.
- Responsive design: Mobile-first with Tailwind.

## Pending Tasks and Next Steps
1. [ ] Wait for Next.js project creation to complete (`npx create-next-app` command).
   - "Command is still running in the user's terminal." - Monitor for completion.

2. [ ] Verify project structure: Use `list_files` on `apps/frontend/` to confirm files generated.

3. [ ] Install additional dependencies if needed: e.g., `axios` for API calls, `react-hook-form` for forms, `zod` for validation.
   - Command: `cd apps/frontend && npm install axios react-hook-form zod @types/node`

4. [ ] Set up project structure: Create directories for components, lib, types, hooks.
   - Use `execute_command` to mkdir if needed, but create_file for initial files.

5. [ ] Implement core components:
   - Header (navigation, search bar, auth buttons).
   - Footer.
   - ProductCard (with halal certification badge).
   - Button and Form components.

6. [ ] Build core pages:
   - Home page (`src/app/page.tsx`): Hero section, featured products.
   - Products listing (`src/app/products/page.tsx`): Fetch from backend API, grid layout.
   - Product details (`src/app/products/[id]/page.tsx`): Dynamic route, blockchain verification.
   - Auth pages: Login/Register (`src/app/auth/login/page.tsx`, etc.).
   - Vendor Dashboard (`src/app/dashboard/vendor/page.tsx`): Role-based.

7. [ ] API Integration:
   - Create `src/lib/api.ts` with functions for auth, products, blockchain endpoints.
   - Use environment variables for backend URL (e.g., http://localhost:3001).

8. [ ] Styling and Theming:
   - Update `tailwind.config.js` for HalalChain colors (greens, whites for trust/purity).
   - Ensure responsive design.

9. [ ] Basic Functionality:
   - User auth flow: Login/Register, protected routes with middleware.
   - Product browsing/search/filtering.
   - Halal certification display (integrate blockchain verify endpoint).

10. [ ] Testing and Demo:
    - Run dev server: `cd apps/frontend && npm run dev`.
    - Use browser_action to verify rendering.
    - Integrate with backend (assume backend running on port 3001).

Update this TODO as steps complete. Next: Confirm project creation.
